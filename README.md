## Overview
This project is a two-way voice-based conversational AI system built as a web application. It allows users to engage in real-time spoken conversations with an AI character, such as a career advisor or chatbot, capable of responding via synthesized voice. The application captures the userâ€™s speech, transcribes it, and generates a spoken AI response, creating a fluid and engaging interaction.

### To help you understand the system, I highly recommend you view the UI/UX designer of the system [here](https://www.figma.com/design/3dSzQgEKr93tvYTxuI3AoE/CareerTrack-Assessment?node-id=0-1&t=DUfo0ZhH6a36o5bT-1)
